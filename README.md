This is a [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) (a.k.a. FCC) project. In FCC, you can build either with vanilla (pure) JavaScript or with jQuery (the latter being probably the chosen version of most people as jQuery is explored a bit earlier in their curriculum).

In my journey to learn Functional Programming ,React and VueJS in depth, I decided to build this project (and maybe all the other ones... who knows?) in four versions:

- Vanilla JavaScript
- jQuery
- React
- VueJS

With that in mind, I started building this simple app and ended up learning a lot about JavaScript! Which is the best tool to use? I can't say right now... I can only say that I recommend this exercise to everyone interested in working professionally with JavaScript.

A quick note: I haven't added all the Babel, Webpack and testing tools so far. My goal for now is to quickly show the different implementations without stumbling on the setup paraphernalia. My secondary goal is to also serve as an example for those who are starting to work with any of these libraries or with vanilla JavaScript.

Lastly, I would like to receive any feedback on my implementations. If you spot any errors/mistakes, please, feel free to nudge me or make a PR ;-)
